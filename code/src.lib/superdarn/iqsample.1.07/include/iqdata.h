 $Log: iqdata.h,v $
 Revision 1.6  2008/03/14 16:13:18  code
 Added a variable the tells you how many samples to skip before calculating an ACF.
 This is from the digital receivers that take samples immediately the pulse
 train is started.

 Revision 1.5  2008/03/13 19:15:10  code
 Removed redundant stereo channel array - stereo channels will be in
 different data structures.
 Added chnnum to indicate number of receiver channels stored
 so the total number of 16-bit words in the array is:
 2*chnnum*smpnum

 Revision 1.4  2008/03/13 16:56:29  code
 Added smpnum and seqnum.

 Revision 1.3  2008/03/13 16:25:58  code
 Added version number.

 Revision 1.2  2008/03/13 16:17:20  code
 Fixed typo.

 Revision 1.1  2008/03/13 16:16:11  code
 Initial revision
