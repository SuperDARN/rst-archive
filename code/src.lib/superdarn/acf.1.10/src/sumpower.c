 Revision 1.4  2008/03/13 22:34:20  code
 Removed "delay". This is the delay associated with propagation through
 the digital receiver, however it's value can only be calculated
 in the digital receiver driver. In the past we have "guessed"
 a value. It is much better to remove this term and account for the
 propagation in the driver.
 The "dflg" remains as this tells the routine to use "prm->stdelay", the
 number of samples to skip prior to the first TX pulse.

 Revision 1.3  2006/02/07 19:20:14  barnes
 Simon Shepherd's modifications to the lag table.

 Revision 1.2  2004/05/04 18:47:28  barnes
 Renamed the type header to avoid confusion.

 Revision 1.1  2004/01/19 20:16:33  barnes
