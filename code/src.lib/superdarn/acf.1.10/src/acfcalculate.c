 Revision 1.9  2008/03/13 22:34:20  code
 Removed "delay". This is the delay associated with propagation through
 the digital receiver, however it's value can only be calculated
 in the digital receiver driver. In the past we have "guessed"
 a value. It is much better to remove this term and account for the
 propagation in the driver.
 The "dflg" remains as this tells the routine to use "prm->stdelay", the
 number of samples to skip prior to the first TX pulse.

 Revision 1.8  2007/04/17 15:38:41  code
 Removed incorrect code for writing hte ACF array.
 The index into the ACF array is not based on the actual lag (tau)
 but are sequential - If a lag is missing, no gap appears in the array
 Missing lags are resolved by looking at the lag table.

 Revision 1.7  2006/08/17 19:02:02  code
 Removed redundant wrapper.

 Revision 1.6  2006/08/17 18:59:27  code
 Added support for extended lag tables.

 Revision 1.5  2006/02/07 19:20:14  barnes
 Simon Shepherd's modifications to the lag table.

 Revision 1.4  2005/07/26 17:49:36  barnes
 Added code to correctly find XCFs.

 Revision 1.3  2004/05/04 18:47:28  barnes
 Renamed the type header to avoid confusion.

 Revision 1.2  2004/04/29 21:39:15  barnes
 Fixed redundant semi-colon.

 Revision 1.1  2004/01/19 20:16:33  barnes
 Initial revision

 /* For an analogue receiver, samples are multiplexed,
  * eg. sample 1 & 2 are the I & Q for the main array,
  * end sample 3 & 4 are the I & Q for the interferometer array.
  * For a digital receiver samples are not multiplexed,
  * so for the APL and Saskatoon implmentation the first X
  * samples are the I & Q samples from the main array,
  * followed by the I & Q samples from the secondary array.
  * The Alaskan implementation is slightly different again
  * using two halves of the total DMA buffer. 
  *
  * The differences in implementation are handled by a combination
  * of the rngoff and xcfoff arguments.
  *
  * Analogue receiver:    rngoff        xcfoff
  *
  * No XCFs                 2             0
