## SuperDARN data access and usage policy

SuperDARN data are published on [FRDR](https://www.frdr-dfdr.ca/repo/collection/superdarn) in the `rawacf`/`dat` format. These data are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 (CC BY-NC 4.0) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

**Please read the [SuperDARN data policy](https://g-772fa5.cd4fe.0ec8.data.globus.org/7/published/publication_285/submitted_data/2018RAWACF.readme.txt) when downloading data from FRDR.**

SuperDARN is an international collaboration operating high frequency (HF) radars deployed in the northern and southern hemispheres to measure ionospheric plasma circulation.  Each partner institution secures funding and manages operations for their own facilities.  The continued availability of SuperDARN data depends on the proper acknowledgement of data by its users. Guidelines for data acknowledgement are as follows:

When data from an individual radar or radars are used, users must contact the principal investigator(s) of those radar(s) to obtain the appropriate acknowledgement information and to offer collaboration, where appropriate.

For all usage of SuperDARN data, users are asked to include the following standard acknowledgement text:

> The authors acknowledge the use of SuperDARN data. SuperDARN is a collection of radars funded by national scientific funding agencies of Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, South Africa, United Kingdom and the United States of America.

While SuperDARN has an open data use policy, i.e., prior permission to access and analyse the data is not required, the data user is strongly encouraged to establish early contact with any Principal Investigator whose data are involved in the project to discuss the intended usage and collaboration. Data can be subject to limitations that are not immediately evident to users. In addition, some data are embargoed for use by designated Principal Investigators for a period of one year. SuperDARN and the organizations that contributed data must be acknowledged in all reports and publications that use SuperDARN data.

The [SuperDARN Executive Council](https://superdarn.ca/radar-info) must be notified before data are redistributed through another database. The data are not to be used for commercial purposes.  If you have any questions about appropriate use of these data, contact any SuperDARN Principal Investigator.
